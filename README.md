A `kea` is two things:

1. An [extremely smart mountain parrot](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kea+parrot) from New Zealand
2. An equally smart architecture for frontend webapps

# What's included?

1) `kea/logic` - Redux Logic Stores. Actions, Reducers, PropTypes and Selectors in one easy to read file!

2) `kea/saga` - The perfect complement to control side effects.

3) `kea/cli` - Scaffolding. Easy project and code generation.

4) `kea/scene` - Combine Logic and Sagas into scenes, complete with routing and code splitting (TODO: the code is still under `kea/logic` and will be refactored soon)

# Logic stores

Logic stores consist of actions, reducers, selectors and prop types. They look like this:

```js
import Logic from 'kea/logic'

class HomepageLogic extends Logic {
  path = () => ['scenes', 'homepage', 'index']

  actions = ({ constants }) => ({
    updateName: (name) => ({ name }),
    increaseAge: (amount = 1) => ({ amount }),
    decreaseAge: (amount = 1) => ({ amount })
  })

  structure = ({ actions, constants }) => ({
    name: ['Chirpy', PropTypes.string, {
      [actions.updateName]: (state, payload) => payload.name
    }],

    age: [3, PropTypes.number, { persist: true }, { // persist = save the age in LocalStorage
      [actions.increaseAge]: (state, payload) => state + payload.amount,
      [actions.decreaseAge]: (state, payload) => Math.max(state - payload.amount, 1)
    }]
  })

  selectors = ({ path, structure, selectors, constants }) => ({
    capitalizedName: [
      () => [PropTypes.string, selectors.name],
      (name) => name.trim().split(' ').map(k => `${k.charAt(0).toUpperCase()}${k.slice(1).toLowerCase()}`).join(' ')
    ],

    description: [
      () => [PropTypes.string, selectors.capitalizedName, selectors.age],
      (capitalizedName, age) => `Hello, I'm ${capitalizedName}, a ${age} years old bird!`
    ]
  })
}

// exported as a singleton
export default new HomepageLogic().init()
```

Check out the [TodoMVC logic.js](https://github.com/mariusandra/kea-example/blob/master/app/scenes/todos/logic.js) for a longer example.

Once defined, a logic store can be imported anywhere:

```js
import sceneLogic from '~/scenes/homepage/logic'

// you can start using it in your project right away!
// ... as long as you have set the "path" to where it can be found in your reducer tree
sceneLogic.path === ['scenes', 'homepage', 'index']
sceneLogic.selector === (state) => state.scenes.homepage.index

sceneLogic.actions === { updateName: (name) => { ... }, increaseAge: (amount) => { ... }, ... }
sceneLogic.reducer === function (state, action) { ... }
sceneLogic.selectors === { name: (state) => state.scenes.homepage.index.name, capitalizedName: ... }

// or plug them into other kea-logic components for maximum interoperability
```

# Side effects (API calls, etc)

`kea/saga` provides a `Saga` class for beautiful orchestration of side effect via redux-saga.

```js
import Saga from 'kea/saga'

import homepageLogic from '~/scenes/homepage/logic'
import sliderLogic from '~/scenes/homepage/slider/logic'

export default class HomepageSaga extends Saga {
  // pull in actions from logic stores
  actions = () => ([
    homepageLogic, [
      'updateName',
      'increaseAge',
      'decreaseAge'
    ],
    sliderLogic, [
      'updateSlide'
    ]
  ])

  // bind some actions to worker functions
  takeEvery = ({ actions }) => ({
    [actions.updateName]: this.nameLogger,
    [actions.increaseAge]: this.ageLogger,
    [actions.decreaseAge]: this.ageLogger
  })

  // main loop of saga
  // - update the slide every 5 sec
  run = function * () {
    // to ease readability we list the actions this function uses on the top
    const { updateSlide } = this.actions

    while (true) {
      // wait for someone to call the updateSlide action or for 5 seconds to pass
      const { timeout } = yield race({
        change: take(updateSlide),
        timeout: delay(5000)
      })

      // if timed out, advance the slide
      if (timeout) {
        // in a saga you can access logic store contents via "yield logic.get('property')"
        const currentSlide = yield sliderLogic.get('currentSlide')
        // dispatch the updateSlide action
        yield put(updateSlide(currentSlide + 1))
      }

      // reset the clock to 5 seconds and wait again
    }
  }

  // clean up if needed
  cancelled = function * () {
    console.log('Closing saga')
  }

  // on every updateName
  nameLogger = function * (action) {
    const { name } = action.payload
    console.log(`The name changed to: ${name}!`)
  }

  // on every increaseAge, decreaseAge
  ageLogger = function * (action) {
    const age = yield homepageLogic.get('age')
    console.log(`The age changed to: ${age}!`)
  }
}
```

Read the documentation for [`redux-saga`](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) or check out
[another example](https://gist.github.com/mariusandra/e6091b393e153c9edf3ba451a9d91aeb)!

Hook them into `kea/scene` (explained below) or call from your existing code like this:

```js
const homepageSaga = new HomepageSaga().init()

// from your existing saga
yield call(homepageSaga)
```

# Component

Let's have a look at a React component that uses logic stores:

```js
// scenes/homepage/index.js - This the root component for the homepage scene. skipping some imports

// A helper component.
import Slider from '~/scenes/homepage/slider'

// Note, you should always import with the full path, so you can easily move things around
// and refactor just by searching for the path.

// logic stores: 1) for this "homepage" scene root componentÂ and 2) the slider helper component
import sceneLogic from '~/scenes/homepage/logic'
import sliderLogic from '~/scenes/homepage/slider/logic'

// select which fields of data and which actions we want from the above imported logic stores
const mapping = {
  actions: [
    sceneLogic, [
      'updateName'
    ]
  ],
  props: [
    sceneLogic, [
      'name',
      'capitalizedName'
    ],
    sliderLogic, [
      'currentSlide',
      'currentImage'
    ]
  ]
}

class HomepageScene extends Component {

  // react will know the PropTypes automatically
  static propTypes = propTypesFromMapping(mapping, { /* extra PropTypes if needed */ })

  // binding to 'this', hence the fat arrow syntax
  // this way we can just pass onClick={this.updateName} in render()
  updateName = () => {
    // each function defines on top which props and actions it needs
    const { name } = this.props
    const { updateName } = this.props.actions

    const newName = window.prompt('Please enter the name', name)

    if (newName) {
      updateName(newName) // call the action to update the data
    }
  }

  // render the component
  render () {
    // the data we need from the imported stores
    const { capitalizedName, currentSlide, currentImage } = this.props

    return (
      <div className='homepage-scene'>
        <Slider />
        <h1>
          Hello, I am <em onClick={this.updateName}>{capitalizedName}</em> the Kea
        </h1>
        <p>
          You are viewing image #{currentSlide + 1}, taken by <a href={currentImage.url}>{currentImage.author}</a>
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

// finally, connect the mapping to the scene
export default connectMapping(mapping)(HomepageScene)
```


# Scenes

You can always treat the logic store reducers and sagas manually and plug them into your existing application.

If, however, you favor convenience, you may combine them into scenes.

Scenes are defined in `scene.js` files like so:

```js
// scenes/homepage/scene.js
import { createScene } from 'kea-logic'

import sceneComponent from '~/scenes/homepage/index'
import sceneLogic from '~/scenes/homepage/logic'
import sceneSaga from '~/scenes/homepage/saga'

import sliderLogic from '~/scenes/homepage/slider/logic'
import sliderSaga from '~/scenes/homepage/slider/saga'

export default createScene({
  name: 'homepage',
  component: sceneComponent,
  logic: [
    sceneLogic,
    sliderLogic
  ],
  sagas: [
    sceneSaga,
    sliderSaga
  ]
})
```

You may then access the combined scene like so:

```js
import homepageScene from '~/scenes/homepage'

homepageScene.saga === function * () { ... }                    // start the scene sagas in parallel
homepageScene.combineReducers() === function (state, action) {} // calls redux's combineReducers
```

or plug it into the kea-logic routing helpers.

# Routes

Give `redux-router` a helping hand:

```js
// routes.js
import { combineScenesAndRoutes } from 'kea-logic'

const scenes = {
  homepage: require('bundle?lazy&name=homepage!./homepage/scene.js'),
  todos: require('bundle?lazy&name=todos!./todos/scene.js')
}

const routes = {
  '/': 'homepage',
  '/todos': 'todos',
  '/todos/:visible': 'todos'
}

export default combineScenesAndRoutes(scenes, routes)
```

... and have those scenes lazily loaded when route is accessed.

# Code structure

While logic stores can exist anywhere, it is highly recommended to organise your code like this:

* `scenes` - a scene is a page or a subsystem in your app
* `components` - react components that are shared between scenes
* `utils` - javascript utils shared between scenes

Side note: as we strive for simplicity, readability and clarity, we will use [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) and skip semicolons. They are added/removed as needed in the transpiling/minimising stage, and add no value. Any "I forgot the semicolon" errors you might be worried about will be caught by the linter anyway. (Please install eslint and plugins for your IDE!)

Here's a typical structure:

```
scenes/homepage/
- index.js    # the react component
- logic.js    # actions, reducers, selectors
- saga.js     # saga
- styles.scss # styles for this scene
- scene.js    # one of these per scene

scenes/homepage/slider/
- _assets/    # some images
- index.js    # the react component
- logic.js    # actions, reducers, selectors
- saga.js     # saga
- styles.scss # styles for the slider

scenes/todos/
- index.js    # the react component
- logic.js    # actions, reducers, selectors
- saga.js     # saga
- styles.scss # styles for this scene
- scene.js    # one of these per scene

scenes/todos/todo/
- index.js    # the react component

components/
- header/
  - index.js
  - styles.scss

utils/
- create-uuid.js
- range.js
- delay.js

scenes/
- index.js
- routes.js
- styles.scss

/
- index.html
- index.js
- store.js
```

## Try it out!

Open the [demo app](http://example.kea.rocks/), [browse its code](https://github.com/mariusandra/kea-example) and read below for an explanation of the parts.

To run the example on your machine, just type these commands:

```
npm install kea -g
kea new my-project
cd my-project
npm install # or yarn
npm start
```

and open [http://localhost:2000/](http://localhost:2000/).

Later inside `my-project` run these to hack away:

```
kea g scene-name                               # new scene
kea g scene-name/component-name                # component under the scene
kea g scene-name/component-name/really-nested  # deeply nested logic
```

## List of public functions:

```js
export default Logic
export { pathSelector, createSelectors } from './selectors'
export { selectPropsFromLogic, propTypesFromMapping, havePropsChanged } from './props'
export { selectActionsFromLogic } from './actions'
export { createPersistentReducer, createStructureReducer } from './reducer'
export { createCombinedSaga } from './saga'
export { createScene } from './scene'
export { createMapping } from './structure'
export { connectMapping } from './connect'
export { getRoutes, combineScenesAndRoutes } from './routes'
export { NEW_SCENE, createRootSaga, createKeaStore } from './store'
```
